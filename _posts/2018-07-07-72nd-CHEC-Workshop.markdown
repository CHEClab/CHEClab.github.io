Prof. Kurosu
Bio: Masaaki Kurosu is a Professor Emeritus at the Open University of Japan, since 2017 and is an Emeritus President of HCD-Net after working as a President for 10 years. He was a professor at the Open University of Japan during 2009-2017 and was a professor at NIME during 2001-2009, a professor at Shizuoka University during 1996-2001. He was formerly working for Hitachi Ltd. at the Design Center and the Central Research Laboratory during 1978-1996. He proposed the concept of Design for Humanity, User Engineering, AET (Artifact Evolution Theory), ERM (Experience Recollection Method) and other usability/UX-related methods and concepts.

Abstract: This lecture has two parts: the first part concerns the significance and effectiveness of HCI studies rather critically by looking back the past research results, the second part concerns how the result of HCI studies should be applied to manufacturing artifacts that should be delivered to users and how the design process should be conducted.
