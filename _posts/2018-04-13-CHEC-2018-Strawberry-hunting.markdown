In morning, CHEC members went to Strawberry hunting in Nishijima Garden. 

A staff in the garden showed us how to pick a strawberry easily ( not just violently pull, firstly reverse the strawberry, then pull it gently), and told us some matters need attention.

Then we started to pick and also eat.

How a lovely day is!
