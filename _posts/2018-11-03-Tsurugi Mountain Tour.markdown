In order to save engough time for the mountain climbing, CHEC members set out at 8:00 am. 

After about three hours driving, we arrived at the foot of the mountain about 11:15 am and started climbing.

Tsurugi mountain is a steep mountain, every single step took courage and physical strength. Even though It's tring, most of members made it to the peak of the mountain. With the beautiful scene all around us, It was all worth.
