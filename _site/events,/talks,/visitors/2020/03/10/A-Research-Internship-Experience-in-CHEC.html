    <p>At that time, I was confused because my ability couldn’t keep up with my ambitions and I didn’t know how to improve it. But again, I learned a lot from the CHEC Weekly Sharing Session, including methods of research, ways of thinking and living habits. Gradually, everything became clear and the vital thing I need to do is to take the first step.</p>

<p>I feel super grateful for CHEC members because they taught me how to find the life goal and the ways to achieve it. I finished the internship with two great things CHEC gave to me, and I will move forward with it, step by step.</p>
