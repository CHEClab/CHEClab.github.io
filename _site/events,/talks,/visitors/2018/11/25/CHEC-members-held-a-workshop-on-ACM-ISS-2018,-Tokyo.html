<meta name="description" content="Although the HCI community inevitably contributes to engagement via beauty according to the attention paid to known and yet to be discovered principles of aesthetics for digital interface design, it is lacking an epistemological corpus which should include the notion, human factors and the quantification of aesthetic aspects. The aim of the proposed workshop is to discuss these issues in order to strengthen aesthetic studies specifically for HCI and related fields. We want to create a forum for discussing, drafting and promoting the foundations for disciplined aesthetics design within the HCI community. We thus welcome contributions such as theories, methodologies, evaluation methods, and potential applications regarding effective aesthetics for HCI and related fields. Concretely, we aim to (i) map the present state-of-art of aesthetic research in HCI, (ii) build a multidisciplinary community of experts, and (iii) raise the profile of this aesthetics research area within HCI community." />
